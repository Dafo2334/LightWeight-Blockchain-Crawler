Hereâ€™s a **README** section that explains what your blockchain crawler does, how it works, and includes a breakdown of your dashboardâ€™s visualizations and key findings from the charts:

# Blockchain Crawler & Dashboard

## Project Summary
This tool is a lightweight Ethereum blockchain crawler and real-time listener. It connects to the Ethereum network using Infura, fetches block and transaction data, stores it in a local SQLite database, and visualizes key metrics through an interactive dashboard built with Python widgets and plotting libraries.

The goal of the crawler is to offer a simple but insightful view into Ethereum network activityâ€”making it easier to analyze gas usage trends, miner behavior, transaction value distributions, and more.

---

## How It Works
1. **Connection to Ethereum:** The crawler uses the Web3 library to connect to Ethereumâ€™s Sepolia testnet via Infura.
2. **Data Collection:**
   - Blocks and transactions are fetched from the latest block backward.
   - Alternatively, a listener mode monitors and records blocks in real-time.
3. **Storage:** Data is stored in an SQLite database for fast and local access.
4. **Visualization:** A dashboard built with `ipywidgets`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas` displays various insights through plots and summaries.

## Metrics & Dashboard Insights

### 1. **General Statistics**
- **Total blocks crawled:** 53
- **Block range:** 22328238 to 22328292
- **Total transactions:** 9307
- **Avg. transactions per block:** ~175
- **Avg. gas utilization:** ~51%

These numbers indicate medium activity during the crawl window. The gas utilization of 51% suggests blocks werenâ€™t being packed to full capacity.

---

### 2. **Transactions per Block**
This bar chart shows how transaction counts vary across blocks. It reveals significant fluctuationâ€”ranging from just over 50 to 300+ transactions per block. This variability often correlates with network demand or sudden spikes in usage (e.g., minting events, token swaps).

---

### 3. **Gas Used vs. Gas Limit**
This line plot compares gas used vs. the maximum allowed gas per block:
- Gas usage fluctuates heavily, while the gas limit remains consistent.
- The Ethereum network does not always fully utilize the gas available, which can be due to pending transactions, low demand, or network optimization.

---

### 4. **Gas Utilization Percentage**
A normalized view of gas usage per block. We observe:
- Some blocks have 100% utilization, indicating they were completely filled.
- Others dip below 30%, signaling under-utilization. This might relate to miners including only high-fee transactions.

---

### 5. **Top 10 Miners**
A pie chart displays which miners were responsible for producing the most blocks in this range.
- Two addresses dominate: one at **47.2%** and another at **37.7%**.
- This miner centralization may hint at disproportionate mining power, which could impact network decentralization.

---

### 6. **Transaction Value Distribution (Log Scale)**
Most transactions are low in value (0â€“1 ETH), with a few very large transfers.
- The long tail on the right shows high-value outliers, likely representing institutional or smart contract-related transfers.
- The log scale reveals these otherwise hidden large-value events.

---

### 7. **Gas Price Over Time**
This scatter plot shows the gas price users are willing to pay, per block.
- Most gas prices are tightly clustered around low values.
- Occasional spikes indicate users paying high fees, possibly for time-sensitive operations.

---

### 8. **Gas Used by Transactions**
A histogram of gas consumed per transaction. The vast majority use under 2 million gas units, showing that most activity is not highly complex (e.g., simple ETH transfers or ERC-20 token transfers).

---

### 9. **Transactions by Hour**
This bar chart aggregates transaction counts by hour of the day.
- There is a heavy bias toward activity at a single hour, possibly due to the crawl being done in a narrow time window or a batch of automated contracts executing together.

---

### 10. **Top 10 Sender & Receiver Addresses**
- **Senders:** These addresses initiated the most transactions. This could reflect exchange wallets or bots.
- **Receivers:** The top recipients often include smart contracts, large wallets, or token aggregators.

---

### 11. **Most Expensive Transaction**
- A single transaction transferred **3160 ETH**, valued in the millions.
- It used relatively standard gas (207,128) and a moderate gas price.
- The sender and receiver suggest this might be a high-value institutional move or a large contract interaction.

---

## Interesting Finds
- **Two miners controlled 85% of block production** during this snapshot, suggesting a degree of centralization.
- **51% average gas utilization** shows Ethereumâ€™s capacity isnâ€™t always maxed outâ€”possibly indicating network health or low activity.
- A **3160 ETH transaction** stands out as an outlier, highlighting how whales or contracts move vast funds with surprisingly low gas costs.
- **Heavy clustering** of transactions at a single hour hints at time-based batching or automated systems.
